Developed a cab management system using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for frontend, MySQL with XAMPP,
PHP for backend. It monitors taxi conditions, schedules servicing, and enhances performance for user
satisfaction.



This system enables a greater number of users at a lower cost, while also incorporating safety as a key feature. For long-distance cars or a particular number of kilometers a car has been driven, there is no surety that the car is in good condition. The proposed system is based on that safety feature with SMS integration for drivers of particular kilometers being monitored, and after the service of the vehicle is done, then the driver and cab are allowed for public transportation.
